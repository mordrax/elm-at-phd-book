# Final words

_Two months since starting this "blog post", we are on the cusp of 0.19, approaching 50k LoC and is almost, __almost!__, feature complete for our final major milestone which will coincide with our launch. I reflect on the last 10 months of development and talk about what I think are the strengths and weaknesses of working in Elm professionally._

This _article_ definitely turned out a fair bit longer than I had expected, yet I still felt like I hadn't covered everything, such as page loading and routing, boilerplate state wiring ( esp for components ), the alarmingly natural way business logic tends to be separated out into functions in different modules, collaborating on a Elm codebase when major refactors are happening, testing, regressions and the list will probably go for a while.
